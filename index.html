											Building with concrete, building with steel. Glass windows, forever closed. However beautiful, skillful and creative, there is always something missing. For this project, I plunged in the relation with these, modern, industrial materials, and nature.
											In a festival that is created around the subject of a 'folly' (structure without purpose), a tree is growing right through a steel frame instead of staying seperated, the heavy frame is supported by a sphere made of cardboard layers, stacked right on top of eachother. The frame is representing the industrial, the tree the natural. The cardboard shows the folly of both, but also connects them.
											Can we break open our fortified cities of concrete, steel and glass? Can we invite some more nature in it, in our streets, plazas, our buildings, interiors, facades. In our lives. Can we embrace nature as part of our world, or do we have to endlessly polarize it, fighting it with toxides, and on the other hand neurotically maintaining it in exactly the shape and dimensions we want. Can we allow nature to take its space in the city?
											The object, a folly constructed of three elements, has been built and exhibited during the months of July and August 2023.

											In a team of three we conducted and developed a research and design project on internet infrastructure. 
											The main theme of the project combines addressing the Digital Divide with the marine infrastructural components of the internet. 
											The research highlights in specific those parts of the internet infrastructure that connect it to the world, the marine cables and landing architecture. 
											The digital divide consists of a increasing inbalance between those who are connected to internet, and those who are not. The main factors for this divide, and for those areas that lack a good connection to the internet, the political unstability, the absence of a stable power source, and the connection of the area with the world via contemporary marine internet cables. </br>
											The project tackles these issues with a single structure: located outside coastal areas in the politically neutral high-seas, generating sustainable energy via solar panels and tidal wave generators and including a datacenter which gives the area access to the internet. By building it underwater, it reduces the energy need for the datacenter and at the same can investigate the marine life around the datacenter pods.

										<p class="aboutMain">
											In a fastly urbanising world, where cities
											are more informal than formal, where
											people live from density, passers-by,
											temporality plays an important role.
											Located in a neighbourhood of Addis
											Ababa, capital city of Ethiopia, this
											projects brings together this informal way
											of living and dwelling with the qualities of
											a formalised building system. 					
											This graduation project is a result of
											research into the life in cities across the
											southern hempisphere, and in particular
											Addis Ababa, and a design of a system
											that incorporates this different way of
											living. It dives into the informal parts of
											a city in multiple aspects: living, dwelling,
											working, socialising, shopping. It centers
											around the single theme of temporality:
											temporality as the keyword of this different
											way of living. Understanding the opennes
											of the system in all its complexity. 			<br />
											The design projects integrates temporality
											and bridges the flexiblity of informality
											with the quality control of a fixed building
											system. In this building system, a wooden
											glulam structure, people have the flexibility
											to build their own space, decide what part
											is indoor and outdoor, decide in what
											extent there is need for space for income
											generation. The system assures a high
											density without isolating the people living
											on the top floor, by extending the flow
											of people to higher floors and reserving
											space for activities, both economical and
											social, on these higher floors, without
											neglecting the vertical distance. 				<br />
											The project incorporates and extends on
											important urban principles and studies like
											Streets in the Sky (Smithson&Smithson),
											public city life (Gehl), African urban
											development (ao. Pieterse, Myers,
											Schmid), urban informality (ao.
											Lutzoni, Lombard, Streule), Torre David
											(Brillembourg&Klumpner) and on a more
											philosophical level the theories of Gilles
											Deleuze and Felix Guattari.

										<p class="aboutMain">
											In this studio of the Why Factory, led by Winy Maas, we dove into 'green dipping' cities with a team of over 30 students. There is an urgency for this green dipping: on a global scale it will absorb CO2 and therefore reduce the global warming. 
											More importantly: on city scale it can tackle clear and direct issues that cities deal with: reducing urban heat island effect, air polution, noise polution, creating a buffer for extreme weather, decrease the amount in which cities sink, and increase the starkly diminishing biodiversity. <br />
											Green dipping proves a benefit for all these issues: sometimes very clearly measurable, sometimes demonstrable through research. 
											The green dip offers a tool in which a part of the city, current or in development, can be radically greened. For each geometry, different strategies can be chosen, different elements attached, and a collection of plants can be added to the building. 
											The tool picks the right plants for the current biome automatically, regarding the different external factors like temperature, sun intensity, weather, watering, soil depth, and places the optimal plant on each spot. 
											The output is the 'green dipped' model, with a calculation of all the measurable benefits as well as the soft benefits, as showcased in the images, with a resulting fly-through example of four different green dipped cities over the world.

										</p>
										<p class="aboutMain">
											During nine days, together with a group of 13 people, we built a cabin in Csóromfölde, in rural Hungary. Since 2010, Hellowood has been organising festivals in the summer for students and professionals in architecture and design. The main design of this project was made by Josep Garriga and OfficeShophouse, but during the week, more and more was designed coöperatively by all the participants.
											This year's topic was Cabin Fever, in which all the proposals were based on building a small cabin, which is inhabitable all year long. The aim of this design, with the title I am a Monument, is to create this enclosed space lifted above the ground. At ground level it does not interfere with the nature, and on top it creates a beautiful rooftop terrace, which allows for wonderful views. It creates a platform for the people to stand on, rather than creating a monument, it facilitates the monument: the person standing on the roof.
											The project builds upon a previous project from a couple of years ago, and thus the structure was already present. This meant that during the process, a lot of alterations had to be made on the original design and thus gave freedom to us as a group to further develop and specify the design.  
											A particular interesting part of the cabin are the interior walls and doors. In a subteam of three, we designed and built these walls in place. There was no existing design for these, since the basic design was altered during the process. The idea is to copy the outer frame structure and put the window in exactly the same location, so that it is possible to look straight through to the other side of the cabin and outside from sitting position. To keep the open character of the structure, but still give privacy to the inhabitants of the space, we used translucent polycarbonate for the wall as well as for the sliding doors. These doors can slide in front of the windows and therefore are able to alter the view through the window, as is showed in the picture at the bottom. One part of the cabin can be closed off with these doors and is insulated, the other side remains open and ventilated in such a way that the light can come through.

											Cityard, a combination of different parties, aimes for a collective and mixed redevelopmant of the Biesboschhal, a machine factory built in 1917. Cityard is a collective proposal of 17 parties, invested in a range of activities evolving around and connecting inclusion, education and innovation: Autisme Experience Centre, Sity Youniversity and a multitude of start-ups and artists. The proposal highlights the monumental elements of the hall: structure, roof lights and volume are exaggerated. The smaller volume at the street side houses the entrance and the larger sized partners. The entrance is subtly opened up to make a connection with the surrounding environment and the other monumental buildings along the waterfront.
											<br />
											The main volume of the hall is kept intact: inside boxes are placed in which a variety of activities can take place. With a zoning scheme, parties that connect together are placed closest to eachother. 
											<br />
											Along the whole length of the hall, a catwalk is installed in which the street side is connected with the waterfront. Along this catwalk, made from locally harvested wood, a historical overview of the place and factory is given. The waterside houses a small maritime museum with a terrace along the water.
											<br />
											The elements like the catwalk, but also an elevated gallery, tie the different zones together: the catwalk with the entrance, a start-up atrium at +1 with the hall, the Autism Experience Centre at +2 with an wide overview of all the life inside the hall.
